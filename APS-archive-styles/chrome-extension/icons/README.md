# Extension Icon Instructions

Since image generation tools are not available on your system, please follow one of these options to create the extension icons:

## Option 1: Use the HTML Generator (Easiest)

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in Chrome/Firefox
2. Click "Generate & Download Icons"
3. Save the three PNG files to this directory
4. Icons will be: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`

## Option 2: Use Online SVG to PNG Converter

1. Go to https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png or https://www.svgviewer.dev/
2. Upload `icon.svg`
3. Convert to PNG with these sizes:
   - 16x16 → save as `icon16.png`
   - 48x48 → save as `icon48.png`
   - 128x128 → save as `icon128.png`
4. Place all three files in this directory

## Option 3: Use Placeholder Icons (Quick Test)

For quick testing, Chrome will use a default extension icon if these files don't exist. The extension will still work!

## Option 4: Create Your Own

Create three square PNG images (16x16, 48x48, 128x128) with any design you want and name them accordingly.

**Note:** The extension will function without custom icons - Chrome will use a default placeholder.
