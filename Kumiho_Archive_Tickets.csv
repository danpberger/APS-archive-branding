,2025-10-17,,2025-10-17,Global Layout Shell, Metadata, and Canonical URL Setup,Implementation Tasks,,,,,,"User Story:
As a maintainer, I want all pages to share a consistent, accessible base structure and metadata so the site feels coherent and is easily archived.

Requirements / Clarifying Questions:
- Provide a shared HTML shell (i.e., the shared HTML template structure — the base head and body markup all pages use) used by all page types.
- Include:
  - meta charset tag with utf-8
  - title tag (dynamic per page)
  - link rel canonical tag
  - Structural landmarks: header tag, main tag, footer tag
- No CSS or JS.
  - Question: confirm if a lightweight normalize or accessibility stylesheet may be embedded for basic readability.
- Breadcrumbs: not required per current decision — but confirm before finalizing.
- Question: should we include schema.org/Event or similar microdata now for semantic searchability, or defer to a later enhancement?

Acceptance Criteria:
- All three page templates inherit this shared shell.
- Metadata populates correctly.
- Canonical links are valid and resolve correctly.
- HTML structure validates and is consistent across page types.","Web Solutions Team (WEB),Meetings Abstract Archive site (Kumiho)",,,,,,,,,,
,2025-10-17,,2025-10-17,Static Generation Pipeline & Sample Data Fixtures,Implementation Tasks,,,,,,"User Story:

Requirements / Clarifying Questions:
- Implement a static generation process using Astro or Eleventy (confirm preference).
- Command: npm run build or similar. (replace with correct approach)
- Input: meeting JSON matching the current object model (add placeholders if needed).
- Output: static directory structure:
  - /meeting/index.html, /meeting/meeting.json

  - /meeting/session/abstract.html
- Question: Confirm hosting target — is the initial deployment intended for S3 + CloudFront, local filesystem, or another host?
- Include 1–2 sample meeting JSON fixtures and minimal documentation (README).

Acceptance Criteria:
- Build script runs successfully and outputs valid HTML.
- Directory structure matches design (meeting/session/abstract).

- Sample fixture JSON is included and documented.","Web Solutions Team (WEB),Meetings Abstract Archive site (Kumiho)",,,,,,,,,,
,2025-10-17,,2025-10-17,Stable URL Architecture & Canonicalization,Implementation Tasks,,,,,,"Goal: Define and implement a permanent, collision-proof URL scheme for all APS meetings (past/current/future) and publish canonical links for archived content.

User story:
As a researcher, I want stable, human-readable URLs for meeting pages, sessions, and abstracts so I can cite and revisit them reliably years later.

Requirements / open questions:
- Adopt the archive URL pattern from the Meeting Archive Design, e.g. https://[archival-host]/[series]/[year]/[session-code]/[abstract-id].html; directory requests map to index pages; publish meeting.json adjacent to HTML for each meeting.
- Document path conventions for multi-meeting scheduler to avoid collisions (e.g., namespace by series + year; enforce lowercase slugs; forbid renames once published).
- Canonicalization for past meetings: add link rel canonical tag with href pointing to archive-URL to live pages during transition.
- This ticket stops at canonical tag placement and stable URL creation only; do not include redirect implementation here (handled in Ticket 4).
- Open Q: Which host is the archival origin of truth? (e.g., meetings.aps.org vs. dedicated archive.aps.org).
- Open Q: Confirm that only past/archive URLs are in scope for canonicalization (assumption: yes).

Acceptance criteria:
- URL scheme doc approved (paths for meeting, session, abstract, downloadable JSON).
- Sample build renders for one or more legacy meetings and one or more current meetings without collisions.
- Canonical tags present on corresponding live pages for migrated meetings; no redirect logic included here.
- All generated URLs are deterministic from input JSON and remain unchanged on rebuilds.

Technical notes:
- Keep URLs ASCII-safe; reserve set for slugs; store original titles separately for display.
- Do not leak internal IDs in public paths unless they are already public and permanent.

Dependencies:
- Prerequisite for Ticket 2 (sitemap), Ticket 3 (metadata), and Ticket 4 (redirects). Must complete first to define canonical paths used downstream.","Web Solutions Team (WEB),Meetings Abstract Archive site (Kumiho)",,,,,,,,,,
,2025-10-17,,2025-10-17,Unified Sitemap & Public Archive Listing,Implementation Tasks,,,,,,"Goal: Make all crawlable archive URLs discoverable: a machine XML sitemap and a human ""bulletin"" listing page.

User story:
As a search engine and as a human visitor, I want a comprehensive index of APS meeting content so I can find sessions/abstracts across years.

Requirements / open questions:
- Generate an XML sitemap containing only past/archive URLs (assumption) with lastmod timestamps and priority hints.
- Auto-update sitemap on each publish.
- Build a global archive listing page (/listing/ or agreed path) that aggregates links to every meeting across series/years. It must not rebuild per-meeting pages (those are handled by the Archive Site Design ticket set); it may link down to session and abstract pages for crawlability.
- Open Q: Confirm final path for listing page and whether it should include legacy series that are now merged.
- Open Q: One sitemap index vs. multiple per year/series for size control.

Acceptance criteria:
- Valid sitemap.xml (and sitemap_index.xml if used) published at site root; passes Search Console validation.
- Global listing page renders a cross-year index with working links to meetings, sessions, abstracts, without generating or duplicating per-meeting index pages.
- Spot-check: 100% of rendered pages appear in sitemap; no noindex or robots conflicts.

Technical notes:
- Keep per-file counts under common engine limits (~50k URLs/50MB uncompressed per file).
- Include meeting JSON URLs in sitemap if we want them discoverable by external tools.

Dependencies:
- Depends on Ticket 1 (URL Architecture) to define canonical and stable paths before sitemap generation.","Web Solutions Team (WEB),Meetings Abstract Archive site (Kumiho)",,,,,,,,,,
,2025-10-17,,2025-10-17,Google Scholar Bibliographic Metadata,Implementation Tasks,,,,,,"Goal: Embed complete meta name citation tags on abstract/session pages so Google Scholar can index properly.

User story:
As a scholar, I want complete bibliographic metadata on abstract pages so my citations resolve correctly in Google Scholar.

Requirements / open questions:
- Source of truth is the static meeting JSON (assumption). Map fields to the Scholar spec.
- Required/primary tags per spec include (non-exhaustive): citation_title, citation_conference_title, citation_publication_date (YYYY[/MM[/DD]]), citation_author (repeatable with grouped author info), citation_author_institution (repeatable), citation_author_email (if policy allows), citation_abstract, citation_pdf_url (if available, must be same host as HTML), citation_publisher, citation_language, and optional conference fields/keywords where applicable.
- Encoding & escaping: use same page encoding (UTF-8), escape angle brackets and ampersands and any delimiter characters in meta values; skip missing fields (no placeholders).
- Author ordering must match the abstract; group each author's fields with citation_author first; ORCID optional (citation_author_orcid).
- Publication vs. online dates: include at least one of citation_publication_date or citation_online_date; both allowed when distinct.
- Open Q: Are author emails permitted under APS privacy policy for public pages? If not, omit citation_author_email.
- Open Q: Confirm the publisher string to use consistently (e.g., ""American Physical Society"").

Acceptance criteria:
- For a sample set (200 or more abstracts across 3 or more meetings), pages contain valid, escaped citation meta tags meeting the above rules; automated validator shows no missing required fields.
- Author order in tags matches display order; multi-author grouping verified.
- If PDFs exist, citation_pdf_url resolves on the same host as the abstract HTML; otherwise tag omitted.
- Spot-checked by fetching HTML and parsing tags; results match JSON values.

Technical notes:
- Include keywords via citation_keywords (semicolon-separated) when available; support conference abbreviations via citation_conference_abbrev (repeatable).
- Consider citation_fulltext_world_readable when content is permanently free-to-read.

Dependencies:
- Depends on Ticket 1 (canonical URLs) to ensure consistent metadata linking.
- Runs after Ticket 2 (sitemap) for discoverability testing.
- Must complete and pass validation before Ticket 4 (redirects) is enabled to avoid crawler confusion.","Web Solutions Team (WEB),Meetings Abstract Archive site (Kumiho)",,,,,,,,,,
,2025-10-17,,2025-10-17,Legacy Redirects (Epitome to meetings.aps.org),Implementation Tasks,,,,,,"Goal: Preserve link equity and user bookmarks by redirecting legacy Epitome abstract URLs (and other prior hosts) to the new archive URLs.

User story:
As a researcher following an old link, I want to land on the correct modern abstract page without errors so I can access the content seamlessly.

Requirements / open questions:
- Implement HTTP 308 Permanent Redirects from all legacy abstract/session/meeting URLs to the canonical archive URLs.
- Open Q: Do we have a complete mapping of legacy URLs to new URLs? If not, plan a derivation strategy (e.g., from legacy IDs, slugs, or exported tables) and produce a mapping file under version control.
- Redirects must preserve query strings where necessary and avoid redirect chains/loops.
- Staged rollout: enable per-meeting after Ticket 1 canonical tags are live and after Ticket 3 metadata passes validation.
- Scope note: This ticket does not modify canonical tags or URL patterns; those are defined in Ticket 1.

Acceptance criteria:
- Mapping exists and covers 99% or more of legacy URLs for targeted migrations; missing entries logged and remediated.
- Hitting a sample of legacy URLs returns 308 to the expected archive URL; latency under 150ms at edge.
- Search Console shows decreasing legacy 404s and successful canonicalization.

Technical notes:
- Prefer edge-level rules (e.g., CloudFront Functions/Lambda@Edge) or origin rewrites depending on hosting.
- Maintain a regression test that crawls the mapping and verifies 308 targets.

Dependencies:
- Depends on Ticket 1 (URL Architecture) to know canonical targets.
- Runs after Ticket 3 (metadata) so redirect targets are fully indexed and validated.","Web Solutions Team (WEB),Meetings Abstract Archive site (Kumiho)",,,,,,,,,,
